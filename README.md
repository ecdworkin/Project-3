# Project-3
Project was completed by team members as reflected on Git. What may not be reflected (at the time of writing) is contributions made by member Trevor Dorn, who was an active part of this project, but had some issues with malware. His contributions included: all SQL related portions, as well as input on other sections of the project and active participation in project design.

Considerations on Data Ethics:
This project is not particularly effected by ethics considerations. We would still like to note that we considered how certain populations are unfairly treated within the crimial justice system when debating the inclusion of crime statistics. We still chose to include them as our scenario is based off a real estate investment group, which would be agnostic to racial justice considerations and is only concerned with finding a strong position to take.
