Considerations on Data Ethics:
This project is not particularly effected by ethics considerations. We would still like to note that we considered how certain populations are unfairly treated within the crimial justice system when debating the inclusion of crime statistics. We still chose to include them as our scenario is based off a real estate investment group, which would be agnostic to racial justice considerations and is only concerned with finding a strong position to take.
